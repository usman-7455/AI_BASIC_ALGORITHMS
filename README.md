# AI_BASIC_ALGORITHMS
# AI-Based Games Collection

This project is a collection of classic games implemented in Python with artificial intelligence algorithms. It features intelligent gameplay using various search and optimization techniques including **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**, **Hill Climbing**, **Simulated Annealing**, and **Local Beam Search**.

## üß† Games and AI Techniques Used

### ‚ôüÔ∏è Checkers
- **AI Technique:** Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Implements intelligent opponent decision-making using tree-based search for optimal moves.

### ‚ùå‚≠ï Tic Tac Toe
- **AI Technique:** Minimax with and without Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Two versions to demonstrate the impact of pruning on performance and decision efficiency.

### üëë N-Queens
- **AI Techniques:** Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Local Beam Search
- Solves the N-Queens constraint satisfaction problem using heuristic and probabilistic local search methods.
